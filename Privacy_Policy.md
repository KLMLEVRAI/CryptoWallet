# Privacy Policy for CryptoWallet

**Last Updated: [Current Date]**

## Introduction

CryptoWallet ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you use our mobile application.

## Our Commitment to Privacy

As a non-custodial crypto wallet, we believe privacy is fundamental to financial sovereignty. We have designed CryptoWallet with privacy by default, collecting no personal information and maintaining user anonymity.

## Information We Do Not Collect

CryptoWallet is designed to operate without collecting any personal information:

- **No Personal Data**: We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any other personally identifiable information.
- **No Tracking**: We do not use analytics, tracking pixels, or any form of user tracking.
- **No Advertising**: We do not display ads or share data with advertisers.
- **No Third-Party Sharing**: We do not sell, rent, or share user data with any third parties.

## Information Stored Locally

All data in CryptoWallet remains on your device:

- **Wallet Data**: Private keys, addresses, and transaction history are stored locally and encrypted.
- **Settings**: App preferences (theme, language) are stored locally.
- **Cache**: Temporary data for performance (NFT images, token metadata) may be cached locally.

## Blockchain Interactions

When you interact with blockchain networks:

- **Direct Communication**: Your device communicates directly with blockchain nodes and decentralized services.
- **No Intermediation**: We do not proxy or monitor your blockchain transactions.
- **Public Data**: Transaction data you choose to broadcast becomes publicly visible on the blockchain, as is the nature of public blockchains.

## Security Measures

We implement industry-standard security practices:

- **Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted using AES-256 encryption.
- **Biometric Protection**: Optional biometric authentication for enhanced security.
- **Secure Enclave**: Utilization of iOS Secure Enclave for key storage on supported devices.

- **Decentralized Exchanges**: Direct integration with DEX aggregators.

These integrations are direct from your device and do not involve data sharing with us.

- **No Server Storage**: We do not store any user data on our servers.
- **Deletion**: Uninstalling the app removes all associated data.

## Children's Privacy

CryptoWallet is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children.

## International Data Transfers

Since we do not collect or store personal data, international data transfer concerns do not apply to our service.
