# Ethical Statement for CryptoWallet

## Our Mission

CryptoWallet exists to empower individuals with true financial sovereignty through secure, private, and ethical cryptocurrency management. We believe blockchain technology should serve humanity's best interests, not corporate profits or surveillance states.

## Core Ethical Principles

### 1. Non-Custodial by Design

**Our Commitment**: Your crypto belongs to you, and you alone. We never hold, control, or have access to your private keys or funds.

**Why It Matters**: Traditional finance relies on intermediaries that can freeze accounts, censor transactions, or disappear with your money. We reject this model entirely.

**Implementation**:
- Private keys generated and stored locally on your device
- No server-side wallet storage or backup
- Full node independence - you connect directly to blockchain networks

### 2. Privacy as a Fundamental Right

**Our Commitment**: We collect zero personal data. No emails, no phone numbers, no tracking, no analytics.

**Why It Matters**: Privacy is essential for financial freedom. Mass surveillance and data exploitation have eroded personal autonomy worldwide.

**Implementation**:
- No user accounts or registration required
- No personal data collection or storage
- No third-party tracking or analytics
- Direct device-to-blockchain communication

### 3. Transparency and Openness

**Our Commitment**: Our code is open-source, auditable, and community-driven. We maintain public changelogs and security disclosures.

**Why It Matters**: Trust in financial software requires radical transparency. Closed-source "black box" applications cannot be trusted with your wealth.

**Implementation**:
- Fully open-source codebase on GitHub
- Public security audits and bug bounty program
- Transparent development process
- Community contribution guidelines

### 4. Security Through Responsibility

**Our Commitment**: We prioritize user safety above all else, implementing industry-leading security practices and encouraging responsible disclosure.

**Why It Matters**: Cryptocurrency represents real value. Security failures can result in irreversible financial loss.

**Implementation**:
- Military-grade encryption for local storage
- Biometric authentication options
- Comprehensive testing and code review
- Bug bounty program with fair rewards
- Responsible disclosure policy

### 5. Accessibility and Inclusion

**Our Commitment**: Financial tools should be available to everyone, regardless of technical ability, disability, or socioeconomic status.

**Why It Matters**: Wealth inequality is exacerbated when financial tools are designed only for the technically proficient.

**Implementation**:
- VoiceOver and accessibility support
- Multi-language support (starting with English and French)
- Intuitive user interface inspired by leading wallets
- Educational onboarding explaining crypto concepts
- No hidden fees or predatory practices

### 6. Environmental Consciousness

**Our Commitment**: We promote sustainable blockchain practices and display environmental impact information.

**Why It Matters**: Some blockchain networks consume excessive energy. Users should make informed choices about environmental impact.

**Implementation**:
- Estimated energy cost display for transactions
- Preference for Layer 2 solutions when available
- Educational content about blockchain energy usage
- Support for eco-friendly networks and practices

### 7. Community and Education

**Our Commitment**: We educate users about cryptocurrency best practices and support the broader crypto community.

**Why It Matters**: Widespread adoption of crypto requires education. Many users lose funds due to poor understanding of the technology.

**Implementation**:
- In-app educational content
- Security best practice guides
- Community forum participation
- Educational blog and documentation

## Our Stance on Industry Issues

### Against Centralization
We oppose centralized exchanges that hold user funds and can be hacked, regulated into oblivion, or exit-scammed.

### Against Surveillance
We reject any form of blockchain analysis that enables mass surveillance or financial tracking.

### Against Predatory Practices
We oppose rug pulls, pump-and-dump schemes, and any form of market manipulation.

### For Decentralization
We support decentralized protocols, DAOs, and community-governed blockchain projects.

## Our Business Model

### No Venture Capital
We reject VC funding that prioritizes growth over ethics and user safety.

### No Token Launch
We will not launch our own token or engage in any form of ICO/IDO.

### Sustainable Revenue
Future revenue will come from optional premium features, not user data or predatory practices.

### Non-Profit Option
We are exploring a non-profit structure to ensure long-term commitment to our ethical principles.

## Accountability and Governance

### Community Governance
Major decisions will be subject to community input and voting.

### Independent Audits
Regular third-party security and ethical audits.

### Whistleblower Protection
Protection for employees and users who report ethical violations.

If we cannot maintain our ethical standards, we will sunset the product responsibly.
